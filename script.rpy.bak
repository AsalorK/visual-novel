#NADA DE MULTIPLE SCREENS

#o que eu quero:
#dar assign de um botao a uma localização sem ter que enviar por labels ou mandar para outros screens.
#será que posso criar mais labels com variáveis, e assim que passar uma parte chama-las em vez de chamar as primeiras? assim posso criar novos booleans,
# em vez de utilizar os mesmos ou ter de criar ints? idk...acho que posso continuar a utilizar estes tho. Tenho de experimentar quq

# The game starts here.
